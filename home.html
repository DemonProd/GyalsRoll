    <p style="font-size: large; padding: 15px 12px; background: linear-gradient(135deg, #fd19d0, #ffb300); border: 1px solid blueviolet; border-radius: 50px;">GyalsRoll is a character-collection game that combines chance, strategy, and community engagement. 
      Players can roll to discover a wide range of unique characters, each varying in rarity and value. 
      Whether you're aiming to complete your collection or seeking high-value pulls, every roll brings a new surprise.
      Earn OwO Cash by selling characters you no longer need, and use your earnings to fund more rolls or enhance your lineup. 
      You can also compare your cards with other players, track your progress, and see how your collection stacks up in the community.
      With a blend of luck, trading, and social competition, 
      GyalsRoll offers a dynamic and engaging experience for collectors and gamers alike.</p>
